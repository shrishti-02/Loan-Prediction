# Loan-Prediction
My new data analysis project on Loan Prediction. There were many variable considered before approving the loan of an applicant. Considering those variables,I split the data into test and train and created the predicted model using logistic regression as  logistic regression works on binary output, or on the occurrence of an event. I learned how to apply logistic regression and also learned new things during working on this project.
